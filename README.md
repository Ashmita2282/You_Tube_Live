### Challenges and Solutions

JWT Authentication:
Challenge: Securing endpoints without impacting performance.
Solution: Implement middleware to validate tokens and handle expired tokens gracefully.
Video Filtering:
Challenge: Handling complex filtering and searching on large datasets.
Solution: Use indexed fields in MongoDB and server-side filtering for efficient searches.
Frontend-Backend Integration:
Challenge: Ensuring seamless communication between React and Express.
Solution: Standardize API responses and implement global error handling.
Responsive Design:
Challenge: Maintaining usability across devices.
Solution: Use Tailwind CSS utilities and test extensively on different devices.
Data Relationships:
Challenge: Managing relationships between users, channels, and videos.
Solution: Use a hybrid approach with embedded documents and references for scalability. 6. All the functionality works but reflect after the hard reloading
